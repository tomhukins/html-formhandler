0.40050 Thu Sep 26, 2013
   *** 'widget_tags' in a field have been deprecated for a long time; removing.
      There are still widget_tags in the form and compound fields.
      Use 'tags' in a field instead.
   *** Initial support of Bootstrap3 - still EXPERIMENTAL. Do not use in
      production yet. Changes in interface may occur over the next few weeks.
   Supporting Bootstrap 3.0 required a surprising amount of minor refactoring:
      Bootstrap3 checkboxes and radio elements now have an additional div wrapping them.
      This required setting flags in the wrapper that could be seen by the
      field widgets. Used 'wrapper_tags' attribute, which is not the most satisfying
      solution but does work. The former 'controls' div now doesn't have the
      'controls' class, but is used for sizing. Added new attribute
      'element_wrapper_class' to provide these classes. Split out addition of
      classes to the wrapper and element into 'add_standard_wrapper_classes' and
      'add_standard_element_classes', because B3.0 now wants 'has-error' and
      'has-warning' instead of the former 'error' class. 'control-group' was
      changed to 'form-group'. The 'form-control' class has been added to
      text, password, textarea, and select fields.

   More support for repeatable javascript:
     Tweak Bootsrap wrapper to check do_wrapper instead of do_label when rendering
         'controls' div
     Reminder: It's always a good idea to make your own set of of widgets so that
         updates don't throw off your rendering. This change was hardly noticeable
         in the FH testcases, but it's possible you were relying on the old behavior
         for CSS.

     Add RmElement example field.

0.40019 Fri Feb 8, 2013

      where compound field value is not set to undef when all
      subfields are empty. This is needed for some kinds of db
      relationships, to ensure that subfields are set to null.

0.40011 Tue Jun 5, 2012

    **** There are many changes to rendering, many of them incompatible.
       These changes *will* break existing form rendering.
       You must check that your rendering works before upgrading. Making a copy
       of the old code (the widget and rendering roles) may be helpful (or use
       the compatibility libraries -- see below).
       I always prefer to maintain backward compatibility if possible, but
       a number of the improvements were not possible without breaking
       compatibility, so I did a lot of changes at once.
    Compatibility libraries are provided to help support rendering that relied
       on the earlier libriaries at:
       git://github.com/gshank/html-formhandler_pre-0.40_compat.git
       README at: https://github.com/gshank/html-formhandler_pre-0.40_compat/blob/master/README

    Add Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 widget wrapper

        see HTML::FormHandler::Manual::InflationDeflation
    New 'build_id_method' to provide different builder method for field IDs.
    'auto_fieldset' and 'no_auto_fieldset' no longer used. No automatic fieldsets.
       Can be added with do_wrapper => 1 and a tag of wrapper_tag => 'fieldset'
    Localize the value of the reset button.
    Tests and fix for form 'validate_<field_name>' and 'default_<field_name>' method
        for repeatables fields.
    Change default radiogroup rendering to not use <br /> elements. Add back
        with tag  radio_br_after => 1
    Switch to using coderef for deflate_method; custom fields with deflate sub
        will need to be modified.
    Add block rendering (HTML::FormHandler::Blocks)
    Re-do code for default & validate method construction; now provides
       'default_method' and 'validate_method' coderef setting
    Remove 'init_value_*' from Field (deprecated for years).
    Use Hash::Merge in merging update field info on creation
    Fix bug in copying tags to fields by cloning field definitions
    Switch to using name 'element_attr' in fields instead of 'html_attr'
    Put wrapper class 'hfh-repinst' on Repeatable Instances unless they already have a wrapper class
    Remove 'javascript' field attribute. Put into *_attr hashref.
    Automatically put 'error' on element and wrapper.
    Switch to having the 'class' as a separate attribute from the _attr collection.
       Use 'element_class', 'wrapper_class' & 'label_class' arrayrefs
    Switch to having widget names by default be camel case; provide convenience
       methods for templates - uwidget, uwrapper, twidget, twrapper.
       ** this change will affect existing template systems, if they use the
          $field->widget method to get the widget name. See example templates.
       and conversion methods 'ucc_widget' and 'cc_widget' in HTML::FormHandler::Render::Util
    Create t/share/templates/form/form_in_one.tt
    Switch default rendering of checkbox to have label wrap input. Checkboxes are
        complicated. See t/render/checkbox.t for various options.
    Add 'build_update_subfields' to 'update_fields' processing to allow moving
       more of rendering settings into a separate role
    Change form 'html_attr' to 'form_element_attr', and use builder
    Change interface of html_field_attributes to also return attr (instead of just in-place)
    Remove 'label_no_colon', make labels without colon the default.
       Add widget tag 'label_after'. Use "label_after => ': '" for old behavior
    Add widget tag 'label_tag'. Default 'label'.
    Widget_tags replaced with 'form_tags' in form and 'tags' in Field.
       takes builder 'build_form_tags' instead of default
    Repeatable elements get automatic 'div' wrapper
    Remove attribute 'auto_fieldset'; wrapping form is no longer a default;
       Add back with sub build_do_form_wrapper {1},
       and form_tags => { wrapper_tag => 'fieldset' }
    Remove automatic wrapping of compounds.
       Enable wrapping with do_wrapper => 1 (there's also do_label => 1)
    Put form wrapper around form tag instead of inside
    wrapper_start and wrapper_end tags not used to skip wrapper; use do_wrapper => 0
    The 'get_tag' method now returns '' instead of undef if tag doesn't exist.

0.36001 Tues Jan 24, 2012
    Add two more widget tags: 'no_auto_fieldset' and 'no_compound_wrapper'
    Remove automatic addition of 'class="label"' to labels; if you want that
       behavior, add it in with form sub field_html_attributes.
    Add 'SKIP' to t/config.t test for Template.
    Update Captcha so it might actually work.

0.36000 Sun Jan 22, 2012
    Switch to using 'process_attrs' function to process attributes in rendering;

    Undid setting processed flag when building result in BUILD. Breaks
    existing apps. Re-thinking that part for now.

0.35000 Thu Jul 21, 2011
    Add support for tabindex attribute.
    Generic html attribute setting (html_attr)
    Set 'processed' flag when building results in BUILD to fix problem
        with garbage collected results.
    *** it's possible that this may break code if field values were being
        set outside of FormHandler, or params were set on new. Pass params
        on process. Set fields inside FormHandler, or run clear first, then
        set values. In general, it works best to update fields inside a
        FormHandler class, in a method or method modifier.
        Building results in 'new' happened originally because people expected
        to be able to do $form->render after new, without process. But you're
        better off always running 'process'.
    Add flag 'no_preload' to skip building results in new (BUILD) if not needed
    Add flag 'no_widgets' to skip applying widgets to fields if not needed
    Fix for Date fields in compounds.
    Types Printable & SingleWord use class messages
